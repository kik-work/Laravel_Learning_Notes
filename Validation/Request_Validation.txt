Validation

* Request Validation

  -> its like a security guard to enter app
  -> a dedicated request class to check authentic data inputs
  -> reusable validation + messages + authorization
  -> Controller stays clean, validation moves to its own room.
  -> required | type | format | size | exists/unique
  -> exists = must belong  || unique = must be new
  -> Rule	Meaning
     required	Field must be present and not empty
     nullable	Field may be null
     sometimes	Validate only if field exists
     required_if	Required if another field has value
     required_unless	Required unless another field has value
     email:rfc,dns	Strict email

     alpha	Only letters
     alpha_num	Letters + numbers
     alpha_dash	Letters, numbers, dashes

  -> dates are treated as string in database but in eloquent it is carbon object
