Laravel Guard

A guard is a condition or check that prevents something from happening unless certain rules are met
Laravel authentication uses 3 components
Guard → Provider → Model 
used for : security, control, and dependency management.
Types of Guards: AuthGuard, RoleGuard 
A guard decides whether something is allowed to happen.
notes: Handles login state

Decides which provider to use

Controls session / token behavior

You can be logged in to multiple guards at once


Provider:
A provider is anything that provides reusable functionality
Guards consume providers to make decisions
A provider supplies data, services, or dependencies to other parts of the application.
->Share logic or data across components,Manage services like:
Authentication
API calls
State management
Configuration
notes:
Usually a database table

Uses a model (User, Admin)

Responsible for fetching user records

Provider → provides data or logic
Guard → uses that data to make decisions
